Interactive camp ground website with CRUD functionality
# why
to solidify concepts: AJAX, Express/NodeJS servers, HTTP verbs and making HTTP requests;

to better understand how Heroku works, especially with MongoDB;
# knowledge gained

** still updating this as i work on the app **
* updated as of 1/16/22 *

heroku needs to be whitelisted before accessing mongodb, this can be done a variety of ways
but for the sake of this demo, i allowed connections from anywhere to read from the database;

gained a solid understanding of how requests are recieved and how responses are sent;

how this request/response model interacts with the models, the views and the controllers individually and together;

better able to visualize concepts and implement them in a meaningful capacity;

how to use method-override to send DELETE and PUT/PATCH requests, where the client will not allow us to use them otherwise;

the use of "dev" versus "start" in the package.json

better understanding of Asynchronous javascript, utilized in the context of database manipulation with MongoDB;
